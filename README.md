    1. Data enginnering: Conducting data frame, checking and cleaning missing data
    2. Data EDA : Data visualizations of features, correlationships, check and drop redundant or constant variables
    3. Model selections: Linear Regression, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree, Bagging, XGB Regressor
    4. Reduction dimensions with PCA and opimize performance of the best model: Bagging

 # Project 2: Nasa Turbofan Degradations
 * The project aims to optimize the computational load of predictive models using Deep Learning model-LSTM. LSTM is a common model that widely used in predidicting  upcoming failures for preventive maintenance, but computational load is intensive, which is time-consuming. The project applied LSTM model with AR model, the      idea os
